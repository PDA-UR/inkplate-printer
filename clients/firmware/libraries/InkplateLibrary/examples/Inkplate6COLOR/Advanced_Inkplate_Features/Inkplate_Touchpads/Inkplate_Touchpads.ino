   Inkplate_Touchpads example for e-radionica.com Inkplate 6COLOR
   For this example you will need only a micro USB cable and an Inkplate 6COLOR.
   Select "Inkplate 6COLOR(ESP32)" from Tools -> Board menu.
   Don't have "Inkplate 6COLOR(ESP32)" option? Follow our tutorial and add it:
   https://e-radionica.com/en/blog/add-inkplate-6-to-arduino-ide/

   This example will show you how you can use built-in touchpads (on PCB marked with numbers 1, 2 and 3).
   These are basically touch sensitive switches. You can read state each of these with function readTouchpad()
   and the argument you need to pass to this function is PAD1 if you want to read the state of touchpad marked
   as "1" on PCB, PAD2 for second touchpad, PAD3 for third. You can also use numbers as arguments.
   For that you need to pass number 0 for touchpad that is marked as 1 on PCB, 1 for second touchpad and 2 for third.
   Function will return 1 if selected touchpad is pressed, zero if not.

   In this example, if you touch first pad, ti will decrese number showed on screen, if you touch thirs touch pad,
   it will increase the number, if you touch second touchpad, it will reset number to zero.
